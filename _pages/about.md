I am **Ruixuan Zhang**, an undergraduate student (Class of 2023) majoring in **Integrated Circuit Design and Integrated Systems** at the School of Integrated Circuits, **Nanjing University (NJU)**.

My research passion lies in **Computer Architecture** and **Hardware-Software Co-design**. I am dedicated to exploring efficient hardware solutions for modern computing challenges. My current research interests include:

- **Digital IC Design:** Focusing on **RISC-V** based CPU microarchitecture and domain-specific architectures such as Neural Processing Units (**NPU**) for deep learning.
- **FPGA Acceleration:** Implementing parallel algorithms for real-time image processing and signal modulation on FPGA platforms.
- **AI for Chip Design:** Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to automate the IC design flow, specifically in generating Layouts, RTL code, and Testbenches to accelerate design iteration.

**Honors & Awards:**
I am the recipient of the **Second Prize** (East China Division) in the 9th National College Student Integrated Circuit Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, and the **Honorable Mention** in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM).

Please feel free to contact me via email for any technical discussions or potential collaborations.
